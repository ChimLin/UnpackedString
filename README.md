# UnpackedString
Testing task is an oppurtunity to participate in studying 

# Description of the task

Condition:
Write a string unpacking program in Java. The input is a string of the form [string], the output is a string containing repeated substrings.

Example:
Input: 3 [xyz] 4 [xy] z
Output: xyzxyzxyzxyxyxyxyz

Limitations:
- one repetition may contain another. For example: 2 [3 [x] y] = xxxyxxxy
- allowed input characters: latin letters, numbers and brackets []
- numbers only mean the number of repetitions
- brackets only to indicate repeated substrings
- the input string is always valid.

Additional task:
