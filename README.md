# UnpackedString
Testing task is an oppurtunity to participate in studying 

# Description of the task

Condition: <br/>
Write a string unpacking program in Java. The input is a string of the form [string], the output is a string containing repeated substrings.

Example:<br/>
Input: 3 [xyz] 4 [xy] z<br/>
Output: xyzxyzxyzxyxyxyxyz

Limitations:<br/>
- one repetition may contain another. For example: 2 [3 [x] y] = xxxyxxxy<br/>
- allowed input characters: latin letters, numbers and brackets []<br/>
- numbers only mean the number of repetitions<br/>
- brackets only to indicate repeated substrings<br/>
- the input string is always valid.<br/>

Additional task:<br/>
Check the input string for validity.
